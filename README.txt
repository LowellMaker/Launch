Efforts to put together the project began in early January 2013, after casual discussions about the idea throughout Autumn of 2012.

This repository will include revisions of the executive summary of the project, as well as marketing and other collateral created to promote it.

The first meeting of interested and/or curious members of the public is happening on March 20, 2013 at 6:00 PM EDT in the gallery space at Lowell Telecommunications Corporation ("LTC") located at 246 Market Street in Lowell, MA USA.
